## Description of Project
In this project, we have created a simplified version of Dungeons and Dragons that is played entirely in the terminal. The game features core mechanics such as party management, character attributes, random events, and skill checks. Each playthrough offers a unique experience, and players can accrue legacy traits and bonuses to aid them in future adventures.

## Backstory: 
You and your party finally have some downtime after several long, hard months of going on adventures. As you are walking to the local tavern, a frantic sheep with a Scroll of Speak to Animals comes running up to our party. After hearing the sheep out, you realize this is not a regular sheep, but actually a wizard that has been transformed into a sheep by his apprentice using a Wand of True Polymorph. On top of his sheep-state, there are also assassins looking to turn him into a mutton dinner. The only way for him to transform back into a wizard is to get the Wand of True Polymorph back, but he has no opposable thumbs! But you and your party can help him out, right?

## Characters:
Finethir Shinebright: You and your party's newly accquainted sheep/wizard "friend." Despite his somewhat helpless state, he is still quite self-obsessed and arrogant. He is clearly very intellegent, and (generally) has good-intent.

Ahmed Noke: Finethir Shinebright's once hero-worshipped apprentice who became fed up after not having changes in their relationship. Noke was sick of being seen as a child and expected to do chores. Since Noke is a human, he does not have as much time as his half-elf mentor to learn magic. He realized that most of Finethir Shinebright's ability came from the Wand of True Polymorph, which he stole and turned his mentor into a sheep with. He proclaimed himmself a master wizard, but now he is beginning to feel an immense sense of guilt and superstition that someone else will do the same to him.  

Guz: Claims to be a shepherd of "Master Noke," with Finethir Shinebright being his only sheep. In reality, he is a half-orc assassin working for Noke who believes violence is the best solution for getting things done. He may appear thoroughly evil, but he is extremely loyal to Noke and does not judge based on appearances. He is not particiuarlly intelligent, and is quickly angered and confused by riddles.

Noke's Bodyguards: Due to his newly superstitious nature, Noke has hired multiple bodyguards to protect him from anyone possibly trying to harm him.

Noke's Bed Dragon Wyrmling: Noke's pet dragon (that happens to appear as a bed when asleep) that he also uses for self defense. Appears as if it is carved out of wood and has bedsheet for wings. Not very intelligent since it is still a young dragon, favors using "Splinter Breath" when attacking.

## Location:
You and your party are passing through Transmutea, a small village known for its prominence of transmutation magic. Overlooking the small town is a large tower, where the locals claim the master wizard resides.  

## Items:
Scroll of Speak to Animals: If read aloud by a character, the spell is activated. Morphs the sheep's baaing to intelligible speech.  

Wand of True Polymorph: This wand was crafted from a thin twig from an oak tree, making it somewhat fragile and succeptable to damage. It has also been modified with a bulbous, rune-inscribed iron band that has cracks running along its length. Clearly, this wand has seen better days. It is extremely unreliable and has the potential to transmute the target into a Gibbering Mouther (a lump of seemingly random limbs, organs, and facial features) if the user lacks the skill to wield it. If the user extremely lacks the skill to wield the wand, it explodes.
